/*
 * Which cartridge a save state was taken from.
 *
 * Stock F-Zero and BS F-Zero Deluxe are two different ROMs sharing one
 * executable, and their snapshots are not interchangeable: the Deluxe module
 * rewrites code and data the stock cartridge does not have. The two already
 * keep their slots apart by path (saves/fzero<N>.sav against
 * saves/bs-deluxe/fzero-bs-deluxe<N>.sav, see FzeroDeluxeSelectSaveRoot), so
 * a file can only cross by being copied and renamed by hand. That is exactly
 * the case this tag exists for: a snapshot says which mode wrote it, and a
 * mismatched one is refused rather than resumed into a machine whose ROM does
 * not match the register and RAM state being restored.
 *
 * The tag lives in one byte of the game's fixed-size snapshot trailer that
 * was previously reserved padding, so a 1.5.0 snapshot reads back as Unknown
 * and still loads in non-MSU sessions. MSU-patched cartridges use their own
 * tags and save directories. The trailer's size and field order are unchanged.
