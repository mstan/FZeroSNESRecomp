# Community Grand Prix soundtrack

The project owner initially approved bundling CGP music on 2026-09-23, then
requested removing all CosmicTailz and TheBlurCafe contributions. Eight exact
CosmicTailz matches remain excluded. On 2026-09-24 the owner confirmed that
the replacement PC-port archive already reconciles the attribution requirement.
See [source clearance and historical evidence](CGP_ATTRIBUTION.md).

Project leads are Worthy MF and
Fennor Virastar; see `../track-packs/cgp-credits.txt` for the project credits.
The included MSU adapter source credits Conn, Khilendel and Catador in
`mods/cgp-source/fzedit-msu.asm`. This permission does not change the licenses
or ownership of the music.

The complete source is now **F-Zero CGP P1 MSU PCPORT.zip**, replacing the
older P1/P2/P3 soundtrack archives. It contains 29 PCM recordings (about 567 MB
uncompressed) and an empty descriptor. Files are renamed to the common `cgp`
prefix without changing audio or loop points. `cgp.json` records their hashes,
the eight author exclusions, and 24 superseded recordings to physically remove
from old staging directories. Missing recordings use the game's SNES music.
These 29 recordings are the owner-confirmed, attribution-cleared bundle.

The canonical extracted set is `music/cgp`. Excluded and superseded recordings
are physically removed after checking their hashes; Git ignores are only a
secondary guard. No ROM or unrelated archive contents are extracted.

Select **Settings > Audio > Enable MSU-1 music**, leaving the source on
**Community Grand Prix**, or apply that preset in Mods. Music starts off on
a fresh installation. Custom music remains available from **Custom...**.
The smaller **without-msu** download omits the soundtrack while retaining MSU
support. Select your own music folder in Settings > Audio; its CGP preset uses
SNES audio until a custom source has been selected.

## Building from source

Large PCM files are not stored in Git. Import the complete replacement archive:

```powershell
python tools/import_cgp_music.py 'E:\Downloads\F-Zero CGP P1 MSU PCPORT.zip'
```

This creates the ignored `music/cgp` directory. Reconfigure and build to stage
it beside the executable under `assets/music/cgp`. The release tool validates
the 29 retained files before packaging and rejects excluded or unexpected files.
Do not place arbitrary user
music in this directory. For an old import, run
`python tools/import_cgp_music.py --prune-retired music/cgp` before building.
Previously generated music ZIPs that contained the excluded files have been
physically deleted from this worktree, along with reference music archives and
leftover excluded PCM copies in older capture/staging folders.

The separately supported Conn/Cubear v11 patch and third-party custom packs
are user-supplied and are not part of this soundtrack bundle.
