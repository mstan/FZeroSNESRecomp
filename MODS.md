# Mods and differences from the source games

## Adding custom courses

Open **Custom Content** in the launcher and choose **Import content**. Pick the
ZIP you downloaded, a F-Zero Edit `.fzm` project, or an IPS/BPS patch. You can
change its display name before importing. **Import folder** accepts an unpacked
editor project with its companion files.

The importer checks the files first. If they work, it installs the pack and
you can press Play. Track Pack Loader must be enabled in Mods. A different
display name does not overwrite an existing pack or change saved records.

Original editor projects work best. Some patches need a reviewed conversion
profile before their courses can be used; a patch alone does not explain its
custom code. An unsupported input gets an explanation instead of a partial
installation. See [CONVERSION.md](CONVERSION.md) for editor and patch workflows.
The same guide is included inside the build's `mods` folder.

Course music still lives in each pack's `music` folder and matches the course
source filename. Importing content does not change that convention.

## Opening Records for testing

**Mods > Always show Records** is on by default. It keeps **RECORDS** on the
title menu, including on a new save, so you can check courses and vehicles
without finishing a race first. Empty courses stay empty; no scores are added.

Turn it off to restore the original unlock behavior. Your choice is saved,
and changing a preset leaves it alone. This option does not change when the
lap/results screen appears after a race.

## Choosing menu music

Open **Settings > Audio** and enable **MSU-1**. There is no source to browse for.
Then open **Mods > Menu and event music**. The existing CGP songs are already
filled in; the music bundle is ready to play them. In the smaller download,
the same paths show where to put the recordings.

| What plays | Supplied file inside `mods/packs/cgp/` |
| --- | --- |
| Countdown / race start | `music/cgp-1.pcm` |
| Racers ready / zoom | `music/cgp-2.pcm` |
| Lost life | `music/cgp-3.pcm` |
| Title screen | `music/cgp-4.pcm` |
| Menus and records | `music/cgp-5.pcm` |
| Ending / victory | `music/cgp-7.pcm` |

Use **Change file** beside any song to choose a replacement `.pcm`. Its name can
be anything; you are selecting the file itself. **Clear selection** restores that song's
pack default. These choices are saved when you press Play. Turning this mod
off uses SNES music for these events and leaves course music alone. A missing
recording also falls back to SNES music.

The soundtrack dropdown lists installed packs that supply menu songs. CGP is
the supplied default. A pack can provide some events and leave the rest as
SNES audio. Changing the default soundtrack keeps your individual replacements.

For **course music**, place the recording in that pack's `music` folder and
match the course filename: `courses/moon.zip` uses `music/moon.pcm`. The filenames inside a ZIP do not
change this rule.
The music bundle includes the ten supplied Astra recordings in
`mods/packs/astra-front/music`. You can add those same files to the smaller
download without changing any JSON. Astra's course music does not replace
CGP's menu songs.

Pack authors can copy the `menu_music` object from CGP's `courses.json` as a
template. Its six keys are `countdown`, `ready`, `lost-life`, `title`, `select`
and `ending`; each value is a PCM filename relative to the pack folder. These
defaults appear in Mods automatically. See [the pack format](docs/PACK_FORMAT.md)
for the full example and how to update the pack description after editing it.

## Trying the Huckmine source example

Huckmine now runs from its FZEdit project. In Grand Prix, choose **Zenith**;
Huckmine is the first course. It is also available in Practice.

The example is `mods/packs/cgp/courses/huckmine.zip`. Inside are the author's
`hm.fzm` and its companion files, plus the small pack descriptions and credits
we added. The original twelve files have not been renamed or converted.

To edit and try this example:

1. Make a spare copy of `huckmine.zip`, then extract it into a folder.
2. Open `HM/hm.fzm` in FZEdit. Keep its companion files beside it.
3. Make your changes and save them in FZEdit.
4. Zip the `HM` folder, `pack.json`, `courses.json` and `CREDITS.txt` together.
   Replace the installed `mods/packs/cgp/courses/huckmine.zip` with that ZIP.
5. Restart F-Zero Forever and choose Huckmine again.

You do **not** need to make an `.fzc` file. Bundled courses come with a
ready-to-use cache in `mods/packs/.cache/`, so they don't need to be converted
on your first launch. Editing a project or adding a new course makes a new
cache automatically. You can delete the cache; it rebuilds on launch.
Keep backups outside `mods/packs`, and do not install this same example a
second time as a separate pack.

For optional music, use `mods/packs/cgp/music/huckmine.pcm`: it matches
`huckmine.zip`, regardless of the filenames inside. Enable MSU-1
in Audio settings. Without that recording, Huckmine uses its SNES music.

The `.fzm` file is the starting point; the other files hold the track, sky,
colors, minimap and computer drivers' route. Copy the whole set together.
All 75 bundled courses now have a ZIP in their pack's `courses` folder.
Their names are unchanged apart from replacing `.fzc` with `.zip`.
Huckmine contains the author's original files. The other 74 contain editor
projects reconstructed from the ROM data we already imported.

To edit another course, follow the same steps: extract its ZIP, open its `.fzm`
in FZEdit, keep all the companion files together, then zip them back up and
replace the course ZIP. Keep the file ending in `_Reconstruction.json` too.
It preserves details that the editor cannot store. The game rebuilds the
parts you change and keeps the other parts intact.

Unedited courses keep their existing records. A changed course can get a
separate records list; your previous records remain saved. Reconstructed
projects recover the playable course, not the author's original working
layers, filenames or editing history. They are labeled inside each ZIP.

This example's league placement and CGP magnet behavior are already set up.
For a **new** course or league, a pack description is still required; dropping
a bare editor ZIP into the game is not yet supported. The example demonstrates
source loading, not automatic league creation. Advanced authoring details are
in [the pack format](docs/PACK_FORMAT.md).

Track packs add courses to the original 15. Their required terrain mechanics
follow the **course you are racing**. Vehicle rebalances, difficulty and other
general gameplay options follow your **Mods settings**, including when you
race a different pack. A preset selects options once; you can edit them afterward.
Presets leave unrelated presentation options as you set them. The Track Pack
Loader now enables all installed course packs together; add/remove folders or
ZIPs under `mods/packs`. See [the pack format](docs/PACK_FORMAT.md).

## Course behavior

| Content | Behavior in this port |
| --- | --- |
| Original Knight, Queen and King | Original courses remain available. CGP's revisions are additional cups. |
| CGP courses | Use their authored terrain properties, including required grip/up magnets. Mandatory mechanics come from the pack; there are no global terrain switches. |
| MAX and Bower | Use their own imported course data and native magnet rules. Enabling the CGP preset does not change the meaning of their magnet tiles. |
| Astra Front | Adds ten courses in Astra and Front. Uses the same author's CGP grip/up-magnet mechanics, scoped to these courses. Unused CGP resources and global car/rule changes in its donor are excluded. See [the import audit](docs/ASTRA_FRONT_IMPORT.md). |
| Original BS tracks / CGP BS revisions | The loader and original BS track provider exclude each other. CGP supplies its corrected versions. |
| Marine City I / Lightning | CGP trampoline behavior belongs to Marine City I; the railroad landing behavior belongs to Lightning. |
| Rainbow Road | Its required gravity and illusion collision rules follow this CGP course. |

**CGP magnets:** `DOWNPULL_MAGNET` identifies the ground magnet/grip surface.
It does not, by itself, make the surface damaging in CGP. The separate
`MAGNET` property must be enabled for magnet damage. Red Canyon III's tile
`$A6` has both properties and **does damage**. Tiles with downpull only retain
their grip/pull without that damage. Ordinary native downpull damage remains
unchanged outside courses declaring CGP's magnet mechanics.

CGP up magnets additionally depend on the author's tile IDs (`$B6`, `$CCâ€“$CF`)
and airborne/tilt logic. Those IDs are not treated as up magnets in unrelated
packs. Pack mechanics cannot force CGP tile semantics onto stock, original BS, MAX
or Bower. New packs must explicitly declare compatible mechanics in their
manifest or reference their own bundled mechanics modules. See the [technical audit](docs/CGP_COURSE_CAPABILITIES.md).

## Music, cars and presentation

| Feature | Scope and intentional differences |
| --- | --- |
| SNES music | Imported courses use the donor's original song selection, independently of their scenery or display order. MAX and Bower retain their patched soundtrack mappings. |
| CGP music | With MSU-1 off or a recording absent, the course uses its SNES mapping. The one explicit donor override is Mute City III CGP: Mute City replaces the donor's Big Blue selection, interpreting the author's original-league fallback guidance. All mappings are [listed here](docs/CGP_SNES_MUSIC.md). |
| MSU-1 | Optional. The music bundle uses the cleared PC-port archive; the smaller download still supports custom music. Unmapped packs fall back to their SNES music. See [soundtrack notes](assets/music/README.md). |
| CGP vehicles | One mod enables all three authored groups together. Each car retains its own artwork and parameters. In GP, its other three group members are its rivals; Practice permits any enabled rival. |
| Original-car rebalances | One default-off opt-in changes all four original identities together on any course. Adding CGP courses alone does not enable them. |
| Stock BS vehicles | Preserve their native behavior; this mode excludes CGP vehicles and original-car rebalances. Track choice is independent. |
| Legend and general gameplay fixes | Legend is enabled by default for fresh settings; explicit saved choices are respected. General gameplay fixes remain editable options, and the CGP preset enables them. Legend's CPU changes apply after vehicle tuning. They can affect races outside CGP. |
| Title screen override | One Presentation mod offers Original, Community Grand Prix and MAX League independently of enabled track packs. Astra uses the same title artwork as CGP; Bower and BS use Original. F-Zero 55 remains retained but hidden. The CGP preset selects its title; Vanilla and Satellaview restore Original. |
| Ending credits ASM | Retained as attributed source only; the PC port does not install it. |
| Engine and menus | Course imports use the shared engine, renderer, HUD/culling fixes and expanded native-style menus. They do not replace the game with the donor ROM or import every donor code patch. |

Same-named courses in different packs can be different revisions. They retain
separate identities and records; names alone are not used to deduplicate them.
The records browser supports enabled cups and individual vehicle records.
Grand Prix and Practice share one set of times for each course and car.
There is no mode switch in Records. Better Practice times saved by earlier
test builds are included automatically; existing GP times remain available.
Imported courses show their own scenery, and individual records use that car's
icon. Newly saved CGP Practice ghosts retain their selected car. Existing ghosts
saved by older builds may retain the old donor identity; record a new ghost to
replace one. Old vehicle save states are incompatible with the corrected ghost
workspace; battery records remain available.

The Huckmine editor project differs slightly from the older ROM extraction.
Zenith therefore starts a new set of records; its previous records stay on disk.
Other cups keep their record identities.

## Keeping these notes accurate

For every imported pack, record its source revision, authored course and cup
names, race order, SNES music, required mechanics, intentional deviations and
remaining limitations. Preserve attribution. Do not infer music from venue
art, assume tile IDs have universal meanings, or copy course-specific ASM
over the whole game.

The [import checklist](mods/PARSE_MANIFEST.md) covers machine checks and manual
review. The metadata audit records donor versus selected songs, original
course names and omitted courses in partial packs. Cup labels still require
review against the donor menu or author's documentation. An unknown loader
needs a reviewed adapter, and a structural pass alone does not establish
full-race playability.

Imported intro lettering must be checked against the donor's actual font lookup,
not just decoded name bytes. Astra remaps its font; its authored R and Z graphics
are imported as scoped letter resources. Course and record IDs are unchanged.
